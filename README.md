# Arduino Mini Golf
EECS 183 JP Morgan Chase showcase winner | Univeristy of Michigan EECS 183 WN 2019

This project was the J.P. Morgan Chase winner at the EECS 183 showcase of Winter 2019. EECS Mini Golf is an arduino arcade game played on a 32x16 arduino LED board. There are 9 holes featuring a combination of obstacles, water hazards, sandtraps, and ball tunnels. The player uses two potentiometers to control the direction and the power of a swing. There is a red guide that indicates the current direction and power level of the player's input. When content with the potentiometers, the player presses a button to strike the ball.

Unfortunately the game can only be played with an Arduino Uno and an RGB LED Matrix as of now; however, I am working on a JavaScript simulation for live demos.
